# OpenExpense

A small, composable **expense-tracking PWA** in the spirit of Expensify / SAP Concur —
but local-first and tiny. Upload a receipt, let **Gemini** read it into an expense,
group expenses into reports, and **export to PDF** (with the receipts embedded).

- 📷 Scan a receipt (image **or PDF**) → OCR pre-fills the expense form for review
- ✍️ Add / edit expenses manually; filter, search, attach to reports
- 📁 Group expenses into reports, set status (draft → submitted → approved)
- 📄 Download a report as a PDF (summary table + each receipt embedded)
- 📊 Dashboard with unsubmitted/unfiled totals and a category breakdown
- 🛠 Admin panel: users (name + email) + categories
- 🔑 Admin-only password resets (emailed link) — deliberately never on the login page
- 🔐 Username/password login; **expenses, reports, and receipts are isolated per user**
- 📱 Installable PWA with a mobile slide-out nav

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # optional but recommended — edit settings/keys
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in with the seeded admin:

```
username: admin
password: admin123
```

Override the seed credentials with `SEED_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
in `.env`. PWA icons ship in `public/icons/`; run `npm run icons` only to
regenerate them after editing the SVG source.

## Configuration (`.env`)

All values are optional except `GEMINI_API_KEY` for receipt OCR. See
`.env.example` for the full list.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PORT` | HTTP port (default `3000`) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Signs session cookies — **change in production** |
| `SEED_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin seeded on first run |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Enables receipt OCR (Gemini). Without it, uploads still attach but fields aren't auto-filled. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Vision model (default `gemini-2.5-flash`) |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Public URL used to build password-reset links |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_SECURE` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` / `SMTP_FROM` | Email for password-reset links; if unset, links are shown to the admin to copy |
| `DB_PATH` / `RECEIPTS_DIR` | Where the SQLite db + receipt images live (default `data/…`) |

### Receipt OCR (Gemini)

Get a free key at <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey> and put it in `.env`:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Gemini reads PDF receipts natively (most accurate); images are normalized to
compact JPEG. PDF receipts are rasterized to PNG for previews and report
embedding (needs `pdftoppm`/poppler, or `gs`).

### User accounts & password resets

Admins create users with a first/last name, email, username, and password
(Admin → Users), and can **send a password-reset link** to a user's email.
Configure SMTP (table above) to email the link; otherwise it's shown to the
admin to copy. The reset page (`/reset-password?token=…`) is reachable **only**
via that link — there is no "forgot password" on the login page. Tokens are
hashed in the DB, expire after 24h, and are single-use.

## Usage

- **Dashboard** — unsubmitted/unfiled totals, recent expenses, category breakdown.
- **Scan** — upload a receipt; Gemini pre-fills the fields for you to review.
- **Expenses** — list, filter, add manually, edit, delete, attach to a report.
- **Reports** — create, attach expenses (Add / Scan buttons), set status, **Download PDF**.
- **Admin** — manage users and categories (admins only).

## Unix philosophy

The app is built from small tools that each do one thing and compose via the
filesystem / stdout — usable from the shell or the web layer:

| Tool | Does one thing |
|------|----------------|
| `bin/ocr-receipt.js <file>` | receipt (image/PDF) → expense JSON on stdout (Gemini) |
| `bin/make-report-pdf.js <id> [--out f]` | report → PDF file |
| `bin/create-user.js <name> [--password p] [--admin]` | create / reset a login |
| `bin/generate-icons.js` | render PWA icons |

Examples:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=… node bin/ocr-receipt.js ./receipt.pdf | jq .merchant
node bin/create-user.js alice --admin          # prompts for password
node bin/make-report-pdf.js 3 --out q3.pdf
```

The Express app is the **composition layer** over `src/lib/*` + `src/routes/*`.
Storage is one SQLite file plus receipt images on disk — everything is a file.

## Architecture

```
bin/            standalone CLI tools (usable outside the web app)
src/lib/        config, db, queries, ocr, pdf, receipts, urls, auth, passwords,
                mail, categories, format
src/middleware/ auth guards (requireAuth / requireAdmin), flash messages
src/routes/     auth, dashboard, expenses, receipts, reports, admin
views/          EJS templates (server-rendered)
public/         CSS, JS, manifest, service worker, icons  (PWA)
data/           SQLite db + receipt images (runtime, gitignored)
```

Tech: Node.js, Express, better-sqlite3, EJS, @google/generative-ai, pdfkit,
sharp, multer, nodemailer. No build step, no client framework, no SPA.

## Data, backup & reset

All state lives under `data/`:

- `data/app.db` — the SQLite database (users, expenses, reports, categories, reset tokens)
- `data/receipts/<userId>/YYYY/MM/…` — receipt images/PDFs + rasterized previews

**Backup:** copy `data/` (ideally with the server stopped). **Reset to a blank
slate:** delete `data/app.db` (and `data/receipts/*`) — the next `npm start`
re-creates the schema and re-seeds the admin.

## Security notes

Intended as a personal / self-hosted app. Before exposing it publicly:

- **Change `SESSION_SECRET`** and the seeded admin password.
- Passwords are bcrypt-hashed; sessions are HTTP-only, same-site cookies.
- Receipts are stored under `data/receipts/<userId>/…` and the file-serving route
  enforces ownership — a request is only served if the path resolves inside the
  requesting user's shard, so one account can't read another's receipts and
  path-traversal is rejected.
- Expenses and reports are scoped per user everywhere (cross-user access returns 404).
